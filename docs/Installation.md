# Installation

## Overview

This document describes prerequisites, installation and post-install sanity
checking for Zonemaster::CLI. The final section wraps up with a few pointer to
other interfaces to Zonemaster. For an overview of the Zonemaster product,
please see the [main Zonemaster Repository].


## Prerequisites

Before installing Zonemaster::CLI, you should [install Zonemaster::Engine][
Zonemaster::Engine installation].

> **Note:** [Zonemaster::Engine] and [Zonemaster::LDNS] are dependencies of
> Zonemaster::CLI. Zonemaster::LDNS has a special installation requirement,
> and Zonemaster::Engine has a list of dependencies that you may prefer to
> install from your operating system distribution (rather than CPAN).
> We recommend following the Zonemaster::Engine installation instruction.

For details on supported versions of Perl and operating system for
Zonemaster::CLI, see the [declaration of prerequisites].
